### Introduction:
#### Aim of the project
- Using the PlayBuffer framework,
create a simple 2D game that implements the State Design Pattern as the Player's FSM.

#### Overview
"Zool in DemoLand" is a 2D platformer, the game consists of a title state, play state and gameover state.
The player's FSM was created using the State design pattern and Meyer's singleton to ensure that there
was only a single instance of each state.
