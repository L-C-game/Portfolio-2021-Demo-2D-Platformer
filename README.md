## Introduction
This platformer demo was created as part of the Sumo Digital Academy internship. 

### Aim of the project
- To create a simple 2D game that implements the State Design Pattern as the Player's FSM.


## General Information
"Zool in DemoLand" is a 2D platformer, the game consists of a title state, play state and gameover state.

The player's FSM was created using the State design pattern and Meyer's singleton to ensure that there
was only a single instance of each state.


## Technologies
Language: C++

Framework: PlayBuffer Ver. 1.1.21.07.02

IDE: Visual Studio 2019

Source Control: Initially Visual Studio, later SourceTree


## Launch
To launch the project; download the Repository code, open and build the solution in Visual Studio.


## Functionality

### OOP Design
### State Pattern
#### Meyer's singleton
### AABB collision
 

## Project status 
The project is ongoing.
